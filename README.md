*Hangman Game* ðŸŽ®
A simple text-based implementation of the classic Hangman game in Python. The player guesses letters to uncover a hidden word while trying to avoid running out of attempts.

*Features:*
â€¢ Random word selection from a predefined list.
â€¢ Visual representation of the Hangman using ASCII art.
â€¢ Tracks guessed letters and prevents duplicate guesses.
â€¢ Displays progress after each guess.
â€¢ Provides feedback on correct and incorrect guesses.
â€¢ Ends with a win or lose message based on the player's performance.

*How to Play:*
â€¢ Run the script in a Python environment.
â€¢ A random word will be chosen, and its length will be displayed as underscores (_).
â€¢ Guess one letter at a time.
â€¢ Correct guesses reveal the letter in the word.
â€¢ Incorrect guesses reduce the number of remaining attempts and draw more of the Hangman.

*The game ends when:*
â€¢ You guess the word correctly (win ðŸŽ‰).
â€¢ You run out of tries (lose ðŸ’”).

*Requirements:*
â€¢ Python 3.x
